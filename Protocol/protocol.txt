max 127 markers (due to marker count being sent as signed byte)

-----------------------PAYLOAD STRUCTURE----------------------

4 bytes - time
1 byte - number of markers in this message

for each marker:
	1 byte - marker ID
	8 bytes - x
	8 bytes - y
	8 bytes - rotation

Notes for the future:

Stu's ESP8266 was using little-endian ordering (running Arduino core)

UDP_TX_PACKET_MAX_SIZE was 8192 on Stu's ESP8266
UPD packet header is 8 bytes
This leaves us with 8187 usable bytes
We are using 25 bytes per marker + 5 bytes for time + nMarkers
Therefore we could in theory do (8192-5)/25 = 327 markers

Practically we could do 256 markers by using an unsigned int for nMarkers
Currently not doing this because Java doesn't have nice support for unsigned ints - ugly conversion code needed
Remember to change the marker array size on the ESP if we do
